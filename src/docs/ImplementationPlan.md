# GuardianLayer Implementation Plan

This document outlines the steps to implement critical features for the GuardianLayer project.

## 1. Error Handling and Loading States

### Backend Error Handling
- Implement error classes with proper status codes and messages
- Set up error middleware for API endpoints
- Create a centralized error logging service

### Frontend Error Handling
- Create error boundaries for React components
- Implement toast notifications for errors
- Add loading states for all API calls
- Create fallback UI components for error states

## 2. API Key Management and Authentication

### API Key System
- Generate secure API keys with proper entropy
- Implement key rotation and expiration
- Set up rate limiting based on API key tiers
- Create a secure system for storing API keys

### Authentication Flow
- Implement JWT-based authentication
- Set up refresh token mechanism
- Add MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) support
- Create user roles and permissions system

## 3. Secure Backend Services with Supabase

### Database Setup
- Design schema with proper relationships
- Set up Row-Level Security (RLS) policies
- Create database migrations
- Implement secure data access patterns

### Authentication Services
- Configure Supabase Auth
- Set up OAuth providers
- Implement email verification
- Add password recovery flow

### Storage Implementation
- Configure secure file storage
- Set up access control for files
- Implement file encryption at rest
- Add virus scanning for uploads

## 4. Comprehensive Testing

### Unit Tests
- Test individual functions and components
- Set up mocking for external dependencies
- Achieve good code coverage

### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- Test API endpoints
- Set up end-to-end testing with Cypress

### Security Testing
- Implement penetration testing
- Conduct dependency vulnerability scanning
- Set up static code analysis

## 5. Security Measures for API Endpoints

### API Security
- Add CORS configuration
- Implement proper authentication checks
- Set up input validation and sanitization
- Add rate limiting and throttling

### Encryption
- Encrypt data in transit with HTTPS
- Implement end-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Secure storage of encryption keys

### Compliance
- Implement GDPR compliance measures
- Set up CCPA compliance
- Add audit logging for sensitive operations

## 6. Monitoring and Logging

### Application Monitoring
- Set up application performance monitoring
- Configure real-time alerting
- Implement health checks and uptime monitoring
- Create custom dashboards

### Logging
- Centralize logs with a service like Datadog or ELK stack
- Implement structured logging
- Set up log rotation and retention policies
- Create log analysis tools

## 7. API Documentation

### Documentation Setup
- Create OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
- Set up automatic documentation generation
- Add usage examples and code snippets
- Document error codes and messages

### Developer Portal
- Create a developer portal for API users
- Add interactive API explorer
- Provide clear onboarding guides
- Include authentication tutorials

## 8. CI/CD Pipeline

### Continuous Integration
- Set up GitHub Actions or similar CI tool
- Implement automated testing on pull requests
- Add code quality checks
- Set up dependency vulnerability scanning

### Continuous Deployment
- Configure staging and production environments
- Implement blue-green deployments
- Set up automated rollbacks
- Add feature flags for safer releases
